The analysis quantified the emotion of five economic pundits over the course of subprime mortgage crisis through their commentary on financial blog sites: Calculated Risk, Grasping Reality, Café Hayek, Naked Capitalism and Marginal Revolution. Their language gave insight into how public discourse of the financially-aware aligned with, reacted to, and possibly foresaw the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.

### Dataset

The dataset is comprised of 36,982 individual blog posts from the 5 financial blog sites, and includes the title, date of publication, author, and text for each post.

The collective sentiment across all four blogs exhibited a consistent and considerable negative trend after Fall 2007, which accompanied signs of the negative impact that the U.S. subprime mortgage market was having on the domestic and global economy. The consistently negative sentiment in the blogs reflected more general public pessimism, as there was not much left to speculation at that time – the global economy had been brought to its knees and showed almost no signs of a smooth recovery. The emotion displayed in the blogs over this period of time is not only consistent with what we would expect to see from financial experts, but also what we would expect to see in the sentiment of the general public.

From 2005 to 2007, sentiment oscillated between positive and negative language on a monthly basis. The first half of 2005 alone presents some of the strongest pre-2007 expressions of emotion in both directions. As more concrete indicators of the impending collapse became evident heading into lat 2007, the height of the positive peaks and the variance of sentiment decreased. One might see the distance between sentiment peaks as the perceived range of outcomes for the economy for these bloggers. As speculations and projections turned into news headlines and press releases, the range of outcomes rapidly diminished and the number of positive projections approached zero.
