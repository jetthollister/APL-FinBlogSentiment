We examined the attitudes of five economic pundits through their commentary on the financial blog sites: Calculated Risk, Grasping Reality, Caf√© Hayek, Naked Capitalism and Marginal Revolution. These blogs represent a wide scope of backgrounds and ideologies. The sentiment analysis, which tracks the amount of positive and negative words included within the blog posts, allowed us to quantify the emotion of these experts over the course of the housing boom and subsequent collapse. We focused on how the language of the financially-aware aligned with, reacted to, and possibly foresaw the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.
